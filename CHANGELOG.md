## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Image Click Handlers (Race Condition + Selector Bug + HTML Encoding)** - Fixed critical bug where click handlers failed to attach to images, especially failed generation placeholders
  - Root cause #1: Race condition between `renderMessageUpdate()` and `attachRegenerationHandlers()` - handlers were attached before DOM was ready
  - Root cause #2: CSS selector failure with data URIs containing `#` fragment identifiers - `querySelector('img[src="data:...#promptId=..."]')` fails due to invalid CSS syntax
  - Root cause #3: HTML entity encoding mismatch - message text has `&amp;` but browser's `img.src` has decoded `&`, causing comparison to fail
  - Symptom #1: `querySelector('.mes[mesid="..."]')` returned `null` because DOM update hadn't completed yet, causing all handler attachment to fail
  - Symptom #2: Failed placeholder images (data URIs with fragments) could not be found in DOM even when present
  - Symptom #3: Even after finding images, comparison failed due to `&amp;` vs `&` mismatch
  - Affected scenarios: Direct image insertion, reconciled images, failed placeholders, image deletion, and prompt updates
  - Solution #1: Use event-driven approach - listen for MESSAGE_UPDATED event before attaching handlers, guaranteeing DOM is ready
  - Solution #2: Replace CSS selector with iteration - query all images and compare `src` attributes directly instead of using CSS selector
  - Solution #3: HTML-decode src before comparison - decode `&amp;` → `&`, `&lt;` → `<`, etc. to match browser's decoded version
  - Implementation #1: `context.eventSource.once(MESSAGE_UPDATED, () => attachRegenerationHandlers(...))` before calling `renderMessageUpdate()`
  - Implementation #2: `messageEl.querySelectorAll('img')` → iterate → compare `candidate.src === imgSrc`
  - Implementation #3: Centralized HTML encode/decode utilities in `src/utils/dom_utils.ts` - `htmlEncode()` and `htmlDecode()` functions
  - Refactored: Replaced scattered inline HTML encoding/decoding with centralized utilities
  - Fixed in: `image_generator.ts`, `message_handler.ts`, `session_manager.ts`, `manual_generation.ts`, `reconciliation.ts`, `utils/dom_utils.ts`
  - Impact: ALL images now reliably receive click handlers, including reconciled and failed placeholder images
  - Code quality: Eliminated code duplication, consistent HTML handling across codebase
- **Image Regeneration Failed to Insert** - Fixed bug where regenerated images couldn't be inserted/replaced in message text
  - Root cause: Same HTML encoding mismatch - `targetUrl` (decoded `&`) didn't match message text (encoded `&amp;`)
  - The regex pattern for finding/replacing images never matched because URLs weren't HTML-encoded before pattern creation
  - Solution: HTML-encode `targetUrl` with `htmlEncode()` before creating regex pattern
  - Fixed in: `image_generator.ts` lines 375-438 (both `replace-image` and `append-after-image` modes)
  - Added enhanced debug logging to diagnose URL matching issues
  - Impact: Regenerated images (including retry of failed placeholders) now successfully replace/append to messages
- **Image Deletion Failed** - Fixed bug where images (especially failed placeholders) couldn't be deleted
  - Root cause: Same HTML encoding mismatch - deletion logic used raw URL but message text has HTML-encoded version
  - The `includes()` check and regex replacement both failed due to encoding mismatch
  - Solution: HTML-encode normalized URL before searching message text
  - Fixed in: `manual_generation.ts` `deleteImage()` function (lines 497-549)
  - Added debug logging for deletion failures
  - Impact: All images can now be successfully deleted, including failed placeholders with data URIs

### Changed
- **Gallery Widget** - Gallery widget now starts minimized by default for new chats to reduce distraction
  - Gallery will no longer auto-expand during image generation
  - User must manually click the FAB (floating action button) to expand and view images
  - Once expanded in a chat, the expanded state persists for that specific chat
  - Switching to a new/different chat will show the gallery minimized again
  - Gallery still auto-updates when expanded (new images appear automatically)

### Fixed
- **Duplicate Image Generation** - Fixed critical bug where 4 prompts generated 8 images (duplicate generation)
  - Root cause #1: Race condition in session creation - multiple concurrent `startStreamingSession()` calls created separate sessions for the same message
  - Root cause #2: Event handlers registered multiple times without cleanup - duplicate event listeners caused duplicate processing
  - Solution #1: Add session to map IMMEDIATELY (before async operations) to prevent race condition
  - Solution #2: Add registration flag to prevent duplicate event listener registration
  - Added comprehensive test for concurrent session creation to prevent regression
  - Each prompt now generates exactly one image as expected
- **Image Click Handlers** - Fixed bug where clicking images stopped working after adjusting image display width
  - Root cause: Manual DOM manipulation with `printMessages()` doesn't trigger proper event flow for handler attachment
  - Solution: Use `context.reloadCurrentChat()` to reload chat after saving width changes, which triggers the full MESSAGE_UPDATED event flow
  - Implementation: `applyImageWidthToAllImages()` → `saveChat()` → `reloadCurrentChat()`
  - Critical: Must save chat BEFORE reloading, otherwise reload loads old HTML without width changes
  - Images are now clickable immediately after width changes (chat reloads automatically)
  - Applies to both modal viewer and click-to-regenerate functionality
- **Image Alignment** - Fixed visual alignment issue where smaller images appeared in bottom-left position
  - Root cause: No centering styles applied to generated images
  - Solution: Added inline centering styles (`margin: 8px auto; display: block;`) during image generation
  - Styles applied in `reconciliation.ts` when generating image HTML
  - Small images (e.g., 50% width) now centered in message container
  - Large images (100% width) continue to take full width as before
- **Progress Widget** - Fixed bug where progress widget would appear prematurely for existing messages (issue #76)
  - Root cause: `progress:started` event was emitted immediately when `registerTask(messageId, 0)` was called during streaming initialization, even before any actual image prompts were detected
  - Solution: Defer `progress:started` emission until first actual tasks are registered (when `total > 0`)
  - Modified `ProgressManager.registerTask()` to skip event emission when `incrementBy=0`
  - Modified `ProgressManager.updateTotal()` to emit `progress:started` when transitioning from `total=0` to `total>0`
  - Progress widget now only appears when image generation actually begins, not on chat/character entry

### Added
- **Image Display Width Control** - Added global setting to control display width of generated images in chat (10-100%)
  - Configurable via slider in extension settings (default: 100%)
  - Changes apply retroactively to all existing images in chat
  - Maintains responsive behavior with `max-width: 100%` to prevent overflow on small screens
  - Smooth CSS transitions for width changes
  - Only affects inline images in chat (modal viewer remains full-size)

### Fixed
- **Placeholder Images** - Fixed bug where only one placeholder image would be inserted when multiple image generations failed
  - Root cause: Idempotency check was incorrectly deduplicating placeholders by shared URL
  - Solution: Generate unique placeholder URLs by appending prompt ID and timestamp as fragment identifier
  - Each failed generation now gets its own placeholder that users can click to retry
  - Supports multiple regeneration attempts for same prompt (each failure gets separate placeholder)
  - Backward compatible: detection logic handles both old (shared URL) and new (unique URL) formats

### Changed
- **Architecture** - Centralized CHAT_CHANGED event handling to prevent race conditions and ensure proper execution order
  - Created dedicated `chat_changed_handler` module that owns single CHAT_CHANGED event listener
  - Extracted chat change operations into `chat_change_operations` module to avoid circular dependencies
  - Removed 4 duplicate CHAT_CHANGED handlers (were in `index.ts` x2, `gallery_widget.ts`, `metadata.ts`)
  - Unified metadata access through `getMetadata()` singleton pattern across all modules including gallery widget
  - Execution order now guaranteed: 1) reload metadata → 2) cancel sessions → 3) clear state/reload settings → 4) reload gallery
- **Metadata Management** - Implemented cached metadata pattern with automatic invalidation on CHAT_CHANGED event
- **Prompt Manager** - All mutation functions now async with automatic metadata saving (breaks API compatibility)
  - `registerPrompt()`, `linkImageToPrompt()`, `deletePromptNode()`, `refinePrompt()`, etc. now require `await`
  - Eliminates manual `saveMetadata()` calls and prevents data loss
  - See `docs/AUTO_SAVE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for migration steps

### Added
- **Module** - New `chat_changed_handler.ts` for centralized CHAT_CHANGED event orchestration
- **Module** - New `chat_change_operations.ts` for UI/settings operations on chat change (decoupled from main module)
- **Type** - Added `GalleryWidgetState` interface and `messageOrder` property for gallery widget metadata
- **Documentation** - Comprehensive guide to chatMetadata lifecycle (`docs/CHAT_METADATA_LIFECYCLE.md`)
- **Documentation** - Auto-save migration guide (`docs/AUTO_SAVE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`)

### Fixed
- **Race Conditions** - Gallery widget no longer directly accesses `context.chatMetadata`, uses `getMetadata()` to avoid stale references
- **Event Handler Order** - Chat change operations now execute in guaranteed sequential order, preventing inconsistent state
- **Meta-prompt Injection Logic** - Reverted explicit generation type requirement, restoring default to 'normal' for better compatibility with various generation modes

## [1.5.0] - 2025-10-17

### Added
- **Meta Prompt Depth Setting** - New setting to control where the meta prompt is inserted in chat history for shared API mode (depth=0: last position, depth=1: one before last, etc.)

  - New opt-in "Independent API Call" prompt generation mode (default remains "Shared API Call")
  - Prevents prompt generation from influencing main text response quality
  - Context-based insertion using text snippets instead of byte offsets
  - Context awareness: LLM considers previous messages for better understanding of characters, settings, and situations
  - Automatic chat history cleanup (removes prompt tags from future AI calls in Independent API mode)
  - Cost control setting: max prompts per message (default: 5)
  - Customizable guidelines for prompt frequency and writing style
  - Plain text delimiter format for robust LLM output parsing
  - Preserves prompt tags in message HTML for feature compatibility (regeneration, gallery)
