## Pre-Release Checklist

Before starting the release process, ensure:

- [ ] All planned features for this release are implemented and merged
- [ ] All tests are passing (`npm test`)
- [ ] Code is properly linted (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] Build succeeds without errors (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Manual testing checklist completed ([docs/MANUAL_TESTING.md](MANUAL_TESTING.md))
- [ ] All critical bugs are fixed
- [ ] Breaking changes are documented (if any)

---

## Version Numbering

Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

- **MAJOR** (e.g., 2.0.0): Breaking changes, incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** (e.g., 1.3.0): New features, backward-compatible
- **PATCH** (e.g., 1.2.1): Bug fixes, backward-compatible

**Example Decision Tree:**
- Breaking changes or major architecture refactor? ‚Üí Bump MAJOR
- New features or significant enhancements? ‚Üí Bump MINOR
- Only bug fixes or small improvements? ‚Üí Bump PATCH

---

## Documentation Updates

### 1. Update Version Numbers

Update version in these files:

```bash
# package.json
{
  "version": "1.3.0"
}

# manifest.json
{
  "version": "1.3.0"
}
```

**Note:** These files should already be updated. Verify they match the release version.

### 2. Consolidate CHANGELOG.md

The most important step! Create user-facing release notes.

#### Bad Example (Commit-Level):
```markdown
## [1.3.0]
- feat(gallery): add modal viewer
- fix(gallery): improve FAB button UI
- docs: update CHANGELOG
```

#### Good Example (User-Facing):
```markdown
## [1.3.0] - 2025-10-13

### Added

- **Permanent Gallery Widget**
  - Always-available widget for reviewing all generated images
  - Groups images by message with collapsible headers
  - Minimizes to floating action button (FAB) with image count badge
  - State persists per-chat across sessions

### Fixed

- **Context Caching Issues** (#34)
  - Eliminated stale context/metadata access after chat switches
  - All code now calls `SillyTavern.getContext()` when accessing chat or chatMetadata
```

#### Consolidation Process:

1. **Review commits since last release:**
   ```bash
   git log v1.2.0..HEAD --oneline
   ```

2. **Group commits by user-facing impact:**
   - Features users will see/use
   - Bugs users experienced that are now fixed
   - Performance improvements users will notice
   - Breaking changes users need to know about

3. **Write from user perspective:**
   - Focus on WHAT changed, not HOW it was implemented
   - Use clear, non-technical language where possible
   - Explain the benefit/impact to users
   - Group related changes together

4. **Update date:**
   - Use format: `## [1.3.0] - 2025-10-13`
   - Use today's date (release date)

5. **Clear [Unreleased] section:**
   ```markdown
   ## [Unreleased]

   ## [1.3.0] - 2025-10-13
   ...
   ```

### 3. Update README.md

Add documentation for new features:

- [ ] Update **Features** section with new capabilities
- [ ] Add new sections for major features (e.g., "Gallery Widget")
- [ ] Update **Configuration** section with new settings
- [ ] Add version markers for new features (e.g., "v1.3.0+")
- [ ] Update screenshots if UI changed significantly
- [ ] Review troubleshooting section for new common issues

**Template for new feature section:**
```markdown
### Feature Name (v1.3.0+)

Brief description of what the feature does and why it's useful.

**Features:**
- **Key Feature 1**: Description with user benefit
- **Key Feature 2**: Description with user benefit
- **Key Feature 3**: Description with user benefit

**Usage:**
- Step 1: How to access/enable the feature
- Step 2: How to use basic functionality
- Step 3: Additional tips or advanced usage

**Notes:**
- Important caveats or requirements
- Related settings or dependencies
```

### 4. Update README_CN.md

Mirror all README.md changes in Chinese:

- [ ] Translate new feature sections
- [ ] Translate updated configuration settings
- [ ] Maintain exact parity with English version
- [ ] Verify technical terms are correctly translated

**Common Translations:**
- Widget ‚Üí ÁªÑ‰ª∂
- Gallery ‚Üí ÂõæÂ∫ì
- Progress ‚Üí ËøõÂ∫¶
- Settings ‚Üí ËÆæÁΩÆ
- Close button ‚Üí ÂÖ≥Èó≠ÊåâÈíÆ
- Minimize ‚Üí ÊúÄÂ∞èÂåñ
- Collapse ‚Üí ÊäòÂè†

### 5. Archive Obsolete Documentation (Optional)

If you have completed planning documents:

```bash
# Create archive directory
mkdir -p docs/archive

# Move completed planning docs
git mv docs/completed-planning-doc.md docs/archive/

# Create archive README explaining historical context
```

**Archive README Template:**
```markdown
# Archive - Historical Planning Documents

This directory contains completed planning documents kept for historical reference.

## filename.md
**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed in vX.Y.Z (YYYY-MM-DD)
Brief description of what was planned and implemented.
```

### 6. Update docs/PRD.md (If Needed)

Only update if new behaviors need documentation to prevent regressions:

- [ ] Update **Version** and **Last Updated** fields
- [ ] Add new requirement sections if features have specific behaviors
- [ ] Document edge cases or expected behaviors

**Note:** PRD documents behaviors (WHAT), not features (HOW). Only update if you're adding behavioral requirements.

---

## Quality Checks

Run all quality checks and ensure they pass:

```bash
# Run tests
npm test
# Expected: All tests pass (X tests)

# Run linter
npm run lint
# Expected: No errors (warnings are OK if pre-existing)

# Run build
npm run build
# Expected: Successful build, note bundle size

# Format code (if needed)
npm run fix
```

**Document Results:**
- Number of tests passing
- Bundle size (for tracking trends)
- Any pre-existing warnings (should not increase)

---

## Git Operations

### 1. Commit Documentation Updates

```bash
# Check status
git status

# Stage all documentation changes
git add CHANGELOG.md README.md README_CN.md docs/

# Commit with detailed message
git commit -m "docs: prepare v1.3.0 release documentation

- Consolidate XX commits since vX.Y.Z into organized release notes

"
```

## Tips and Best Practices

### Documentation
- **Think like a user**: What do they need to know? What changed for them?
- **Group related changes**: Don't list every commit, consolidate by theme
- **Use clear language**: Avoid jargon, explain technical terms
- **Show benefits**: Not just "added feature X" but "added feature X to solve Y problem"

### Git
- **Annotated tags only**: Use `git tag -a`, not `git tag` (lightweight tags)
- **Descriptive messages**: Tag message should summarize the release
- **Never force push tags**: If you need to move a tag, delete and recreate

### GitHub Release
- **Rich formatting**: Use markdown headers, emojis (sparingly), lists
- **Structure**: Major Features ‚Üí Fixes ‚Üí Other Improvements ‚Üí Stats ‚Üí Thanks
- **Link to full changelog**: Let users see all commits if they want details

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ‚ùå Listing every commit in CHANGELOG (too granular)
- ‚ùå Forgetting to update Chinese README (breaks parity)
- ‚ùå Creating lightweight tags instead of annotated tags
- ‚ùå Forgetting to run build/tests before release
- ‚ùå Writing release notes from developer perspective instead of user perspective
- ‚ùå Leaving [Unreleased] section populated after release
